#  Jesus

I propose in celebration of the life of Jesus
we move away from the crucifix. The crucifix 
symbolizes his death not his life. 


# Hope 

 ### Thou shall foster one's culture

 ### Thou shall love desegregated love 

 ### Thou shall not lie if self-serving 

 ### Thou shall forward masculinity 
 An assault charge decreases sperm count by at least 140%, I'm not lying 
 
 ### Thou shall dote

 ### Thou shall foster & protect innocence 
 
 ### Do unto others 
 Wise words from a wise man

 ### Thou shall not control the human mind
 
 ### Thou shall not surrogate, especially a human
 
 ### Thou shall Love, hold on loosely 
 Barely clasp
  
 ### Live long, live happy.
 Again, wise words from a wise man

 ### Recall.

### Open Following

The challenge is to create 
something of your own to follow. 
God is within each of us in theory.

Live long, live happy. 
Follow internal guidance system, be astonished
Honor a change of heart
