# Exodus

 Thou shall foster one's culture

 Thou shall love desegregated love

 Thou shall not lie if self-serving

 Thou shall forward masculinity

 Thou shall dote

 Thou shall foster & protect innocence

 Thou shall Love
 
 Thou shall not control the mind
 
 Live long, live happy.

 Recall.

### Open Following

The challenge is to create 
something of your own to follow. 
God is within each of us in my theory.
